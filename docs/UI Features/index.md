# Energy Management System - Feature List

## 1. Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard
### 1.1 Live Energy Flow Visualization

![Dashboard Image](./live-dashboard-layout.png)

- Interactive Sankey diagram showing energy flows between:
    - Solar -> Load / Battery / Grid
    - Battery -> Load / Grid
    - Grid -> Load / Battery
- Real-time power values (kW) on each flow path
- Directional arrows with animated flow intensity

#### Example Design Reference
![Reference Diagram](./design-reference.png)

Note: The above mentioned image, is soley for reference the actual UI will be developed seperately.

#### Description:

**Flow Direction**:

- **Solar -> Load**: When solar generation > 0 and building is consuming
- **Solar -> Battery**: When solar generation > load demand
- **Solar -> Grid**: When solar > (load + battery charging capacity)
- **Battery -> Load**: When battery discharging to meet load
- **Battery -> Grid**: When battery exporting to grid for revenue
- **Grid -> Load**: When grid supplying power to building
- **Grid -> Battery**: When grid charging battery

#### Flow thickness calculation
Thickness = (Power in kW / Max System Capacity) * Max Line Width

#### Animation Logic
- Flow Speed: Proportional to power (faster = more power)
- Direction = arrow direction on line
- Particle density = power density (more particles = more power)

**Note**: The UI designed should be mobile responsive so use flex boxes and make sure they render properly across multiple screens.

### 1.2 Multi-Site Overview (Multiple Locations)
![Multisite-dashboard-reference-image](./multi-site-dashboard.png)
